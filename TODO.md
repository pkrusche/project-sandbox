# TODO - outstanding items

## Model selection for batch mode

In unsupervised mode we should have a CLI switch to select a model. This model 
ID will be passed to the agent and used for all completions.

## Firewall: verify multi-resolver rules on a real iptables host

Code is complete and the render path is covered by
`tests/test_renderers.py::test_firewall_collects_all_resolvers_not_just_first`.
The unit tests are render-only by policy and do not exercise live iptables.
Outstanding: run the rendered script on a host with iptables and multiple
`nameserver` entries in `resolv.conf`, then confirm allowlisted-domain
pre-resolution works across the resolver setup and post-firewall DNS egress does
not leak before treating this as shipped.
